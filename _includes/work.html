  <p><em><small>My efforts on these projects has stopped, although they may still be live.</small></em></p>
  <p>Websites I have created and deployed into the real world, I'm not a web developer by trade, nor have I have any formal training, all the skills are self-taught these include; SEO, HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and the necessary skills to deploy these on my own web servers, these tend to be Apache or Nginx with <a href="//letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a> certificates and <a href="//www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> services.</p>
