  <p>Here are some websites I have created and deployed into the real world, I'm not a web developer by trade, nor have I have any formal training, all the skills are self-taught these include; SEO, HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jekyll and the necessary skills to deploy these on my own web servers, these tend to be Apache or Nginx with <a href="//letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificates and <a href="//www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> services.</p>
