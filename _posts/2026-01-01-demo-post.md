## Headings

Headings are the skeleton of your content. If these look wrong,
everything else will feel slightly cursed.

### Heading level 3 (H3)

Your everyday heading. Dependable. Trustworthy.

#### Heading level 4 (H4)

Still important. Slightly quieter.

##### Heading level 5 (H5)

Used when you’re getting serious — or very specific.

###### Heading level 6 (H6)

If you’re here, you either love structure or made a wrong turn.

<small>Small text — legally tiny, emotionally significant.</small>

---

## Paragraphs & emphasis

This is a standard paragraph of body text. It should feel calm,
readable, and never make the reader think *“why does this feel off?”*

**Bold text** is emphasis, not shouting.  
*Italic text* adds tone.  
***Bold italic*** exists mostly to test your CSS.

Inline `code` should feel natural, like it belongs in the sentence.

Sometimes you need to <mark>highlight something important</mark>
because future-you will absolutely forget.

---

## Keyboard input

Keyboard shortcuts are sacred.

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy.  
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the terminal
(and feel powerful for 0.3 seconds before typing `ls` again).

---

## Abbreviations

Hover-friendly, context-saving goodness.

<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>  
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

---

## Blockquotes

For quotes, specs, or things someone said once and now denies.

> I fixed it by changing one line.  
> I no longer remember which line.
>
> — Every Linux user, eventually

## Callouts / Admonitions

<div class="callout callout-note">
  This is a note callout. Calm. Helpful. Non-threatening.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-tip">
  This is a tip callout. Wisdom earned the hard way.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  This is a warning callout. Pause. Read twice.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-danger">
  This is a danger callout. Something will break.
</div>

## Lists

### Unordered list

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Ordered list

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step (confidence fading)

---

## Task lists

Because ticking boxes feels productive.

- [x] Write style post
- [ ] Style everything
- [ ] Double-check edge cases
- [x] Celebrate quietly

---

## Definition lists

<dl>
  <dt>Term</dt>
  <dd>A concise explanation of the term.</dd>

  <dt>Another term</dt>
  <dd>More detail for clarity.</dd>
</dl>

## Code blocks

### Plain preformatted block

```
This is a plain preformatted block.
Perfect for logs or quiet despair.
```

### Syntax highlighted code

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SITE_DIR="$(pwd)"
PORT=4000

echo "Starting site build in $SITE_DIR..."

if ! command -v bundle >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Error: Bundler is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Verifies Gems and install
bundle check || bundle install

# Generate a static site from your Jekyll project
bundle exec jekyll build

# Build the site and make it available on a local server
bundle exec jekyll serve --port "$PORT" --livereload

# Last Comment, you found the "show more" button, hurrah!
```

```css
.post-content {
  max-width: 65ch;
  line-height: 1.7;
}
```

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% if post.tags.size > 0 %}
  <span class="post-tags">
    {% for tag in post.tags %}
      <span class="tag">{{ tag }}</span>
    {% endfor %}
  </span>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```

## GitHub-style diffs

```diff
- const apiEndpoint = "https://api.oldservice.com";
+ const apiEndpoint = "https://api.newservice.com";
```

---

## Revisions

The original implementation <del>used a global configuration file</del>
<ins>now uses scoped configuration</ins>, which everyone agreed was obvious later.

## Footnotes

Here is a sentence with a footnote reference that seems important at the time.[^1]

Another sentence that probably didn’t need a footnote, but here we are.[^2]


[^1]: This footnote was added after someone said "we should probably explain that" but nobody remembers what *that* was anymore.

[^2]: Verified on Linux, untested on Windows, absolutely broken on a Friday afternoon.

## Final thoughts

If everything in this post looks calm, readable, and intentional, your theme is in a really good place.

Keep this page around as a friendly checkpoint — a visual regression test, a styling reference, and a small reminder that you took the time to make things feel nice for future readers (including future-you).
