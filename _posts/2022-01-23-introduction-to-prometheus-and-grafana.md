### Logging and Monitoring

Logging is the qualitative data, its related to the state or an event of an application or service. Whereas Monitoring (Time Series, Metric data) is the quantitative data, it relates to data about the rate of change.

An example of logging is to look at in Linux the syslog file `cat /var/log/syslog`.

An example of monitoring in Linux is to use the `top` command.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is pull-based and time series, used in a generic environment with Kubernetes integration. Prometheus captures and stores metrics and has an alerting capability using "[AlertManager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)".

Prometheus is built to be reliable, standalone and self-containing, this ensures that the service continues to run even when other elements of the network are broken. Prometheus can also be installed within a Kubernetes cluster.

**Prometheus Server Components**

1. **Retrieval** - Data Retrieval Worker
2. **Storage** - Time Series Database
3. **HTTP Server** - Accepts PromQL queries

Prometheus monitors targets, which contain metrics. Metrics are collected by pulling from HTTP requests such as `http://{hostname}/metrics`.

If metrics cannot be collected directly, Prometheus [Exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) can be installed on targets to convert metrics to data that is understandable by Prometheus and also expose them to the Prometheus server.

Prometheus comes with a WebUI where queries can be executed and graphed on a per query basis. Grafana is a popular Dashboard application to create visual dashboards using the metrics collected by Prometheus.

## Installation of Prometheus and Grafana

In this demonstration I will be installing Prometheus and Grafana on two different Ubuntu LXC containers using Proxmox, although both services can also be setup using Docker.

### Prometheus

Update and Upgrade the server

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install the Prometheus server

```bash
sudo apt install -y prometheus prometheus-alertmanager
```

Check status of service and find the server IP address

```bash
systemctl status prometheus

ip addr
```

Visit IP address of server using port 9090

```
http://192.168.1.x:9090
```

### Granfana OSS

OSS stands for Open-Source Source. Grafana is available in OSS or Enterprise editions.

Update and Upgrade the server

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install Grafana from APT repository

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

For stable repository

```bash
echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

Update repositories and Install Grafana

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y grafana
```

Start and Check Grafana Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
systemctl status grafana-server
```

Start Grafana on server boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service
```

find the server IP address

```bash
ip addr
```

Visit IP address of server using port 3000

```
http://192.168.1.x:3000
```

Default username and password is admin/admin

## Prometheus Configuration

Prometheus configuration file is located under `/etc/prometheus/` and is called '**prometheus.yml**' and if you have alert manager installed that will have its own YAML configuration file called '**alertmanager.yml**' as shown in the figure below.

![monitoring-prometheus-yml-configs](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-yml-configs.png)

The '**prometheus.yml**' comes with a sample configuration, as shown in the figure below.

It is comprised of four sections

1. **global** - controls Prometheus server's global configuration.
   * "scrape_interval" controls how often targets will be scraped.
   * "evaluation_interval" controls how often rules are evaluated.
2. **alerting** - configuration used by Alert Manager if installed.
3. **rule_files** - used to specify the location of rules.
4. **scrape_configs** - controls what Prometheus monitors

![monitoring-prometheus-sample-config](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-sample-config.png)

### Monitoring another node

I will be deploying the [Node-Exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/node-exporter) container on another system using Docker and Portainer. Once deployed metrics are available at the following address.

```
http://192.168.1.x:9100/metrics
```

Now we can edit our Prometheus server scrape config to start monitoring this Exporter. First edit the Prometheus YAML configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Then add the following within the existing `job_name` section, use the server host name or IP address.

```yaml
- job_name: node
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100','192.168.1.x:9100']
```

![monitoring-prometheus-node-exporter-config](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-node-exporter-config-1.png)

Lastly restart the Prometheus service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

Now then we visit the WebUI and navigate to **Status** > **Targets**, the new node should display and report a status of "UP", as shown in the figure below.

![monitoring-prometheus-node-exporter-config-2](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-node-exporter-config-2.png)

### Queries and Graphing

Prometheus uses the language PromQL to write query expressions. I have a crude demonstration showing how to extract usable data.

First navigate to **Graph**. Using the drop down menu, right of the execute button or start typing enter the following.

<u>All available metrics are not added immediately, an update needs to occur for them to be added.</u>

```
node_hwmon_temp_celsius
```

This query uses the node-exporter to query for hardware temperatures in Celsius. In the Element pane we can see the returned values.

![monitoring-prometheus-query-1](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-query-1.png)

By using curly braces we can filter the results to only the included instance.

```
node_hwmon_temp_celsius{instance="192.168.1.x:9100"}
```

![monitoring-prometheus-query-2](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-query-2.png)

Filters can be stacked and separated using a comma between filters.

```
node_hwmon_temp_celsius{chip="platform_coretemp_0",instance="192.168.1.x:9100"}
```

![monitoring-prometheus-query-3](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-query-3.png)

Spend some time playing with metrics and using the operators below to manipulate the data.

#### PromQL Operators

Arithmetic Operators

* \+ (add)
* â€“ (subtract)
* \* (multiply)
* / (divide)
* % (percentage)
* ^ (exponents)

Comparison Binary Operators

* == (equal to)
* != (does not equal)
* \> (greater than)
* < (less than)
* \>= (greater than or equal to)
* <= (less than or equal to)

Aggregation Operators

* sum
* avg
* min
* max
* group
* count
* count_values
* topk
* bottomk
* quantile
* stddev
* stdvar

## Grafana Configuration

The Grafana dashboard is available using port 3000 by default.

The first step in Grafana is to add our Prometheus data source. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Data sources**.

![monitoring-prometheus-grafana-1](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-grafana-1.png)

As no data sources have been configured there will be a big "Add data source" button, click that.

Now select "Prometheus" from the available sources. The only information we need to provide in this demonstration is the URL of our Prometheus server, including the port.

![monitoring-prometheus-grafana-2](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-grafana-2.png)

Add and test the connection.

![monitoring-prometheus-grafana-3](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-grafana-3.png)

Now we can start to create our own dashboards or import one. In this demonstration I will be importing the [Node Exporter Full](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860) (id: 1860) dashboard.

Grafana Dashboards are available at [https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/).

Navigate to **Dashboards** > **Browse** and click **Import**.

![monitoring-prometheus-grafana-4](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-grafana-4.png)

Either enter the full URL of the dashboard or the ID number and then click **Load**.

![monitoring-prometheus-grafana-5](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-grafana-5.png)

Now we can set a dashboard name and set its folder, I will be leaving this as default values in this demonstration.

Set the Prometheus server from the drop down menu, then click **Import** to complete.

![monitoring-prometheus-grafana-6](/assets/images/posts/monitoring-prometheus-grafana-6.png)

If successful you will now have a dashboard displaying all the node-exporter metrics collected by Prometheus.
